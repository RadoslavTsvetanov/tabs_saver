should i use a linked list for tracking changes
since updating a task logs multiple times how to get over that
ask if i should maintain individual state for each session since they will be updated regularly in their own. E.g. the active session will be updated regularly
when using a utlity class multiple times should i make it as part of the context or jut import it everywhere
ask if it is bad to manage the state of username and current session two way like currently or just use the storage to regulate the context value
