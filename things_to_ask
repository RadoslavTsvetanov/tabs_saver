should i use a linked list for tracking changes
since updating a task logs multiple times how to get over that
ask if i should maintain individual state for each session since they will be updated regularly in their own. E.g. the active session will be updated regularly
when using a utlity class multiple times should i make it as part of the context or jut import it everywhere
